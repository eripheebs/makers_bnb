Makers BNB
=================
What it can do:
-------
1. Users can sign-up and log-in
2. Users can list a new spaces
3. Users can list multiple spaces
4. Users can name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
5. Users can offer a range of dates where their space is available.
6. Users can request to hire any space for a range of dates.
7. When a request has been made, it has to be approved by the user that owns that space.
8. Once it's approved, a booking is made.
9. Nights for which a space has already been booked are then no longer available for users to book that space.
10. Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
11. Users receive an email every time they sign-up, request a space or have a space requested.
12. Users can pay for their booking through the Stripe API.
13. Additionally: we have a branch which has a chatroom for the site (branch 9-chat-functionality)
